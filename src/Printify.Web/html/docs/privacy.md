# Privacy Policy

This privacy policy explains how Virtual Printer collects, uses, and protects your information.

## Information We Collect

## How We Use Your Information

We use collected data to:
- Provide the printer emulation service

- Improve the service

We do **not**:
- Sell your data to third parties
- Use your data for advertising
- Share your data with external services (except infrastructure providers)

## Data Storage and Security

### Storage

- Workspace tokens are cryptographically hashed
- Documents are stored in their original ESC/POS format

### Retention
- **Documents**: Automatically deleted after **30 days**
- **Workspaces**: Expire **30 days** after last document
- **Expired data**: May be permanently deleted without notice

### Security Measures

## Important Security Limitation

> **WARNING:** Data transmission to virtual-printer.online printers is NOT encrypted.

When using printers hosted on virtual-printer.online, print data sent over raw TCP connections:
- Travels unencrypted over the network
- May be intercepted by third parties
- Should never contain sensitive information

**Self-hosted deployments:** If you host Virtual Printer on your own infrastructure, data transmission security is your administrator's responsibility.

See our [Security](/docs/security) page for detailed guidance on safe usage and deployment modes.

We do not share your data with third parties except:
- **Infrastructure providers** (cloud hosting, required for service operation)
- **Legal requirements** (if required by law or legal process)

We do not use third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.
