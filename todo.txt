todo
- It might be worth moving BuildCommandDescription from src/Printify.Web/Mapping/DocumentMapper.cs into the ESC/POS command descriptors (see src/Printify.Infrastructure/Printing/EscPos/CommandDescriptors/ICommandDescriptor.cs) so command metadata lives with parsing.
- store relative path to media, not full local path
- add hint when hovering over icons (stopped warning, toggle operatinops)
- use "esc/pos emulation" phrasing in ui, not "esc/pos". Same with epl zpl tspl
- add clear endpoint to clear documents and UI implementation

completed
- Printers do not start automatically when the server starts.
- When open printer, it doesn't subscribe to  documents stream
- keep transparent background for images
